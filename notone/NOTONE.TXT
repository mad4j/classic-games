THE GAME OF NOTONE IS PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS AND 
A PAIR OF DICE. THERE ARE TEN ROUNDS IN THE GAME. 
ONE ROUND CONSISTING OF ONE TURN FOR EACH PLAYER. 
PLAYERS (YOURSELF AND THE COMPUTER) ADD THE SCORE 
THEY ATTAIN ON EACH ROUND. AND THE PLAYER WITH THE 
HIGHEST SCORE AFTER TEN ROUNDS IS THE WINNER ON 
EACH TURN THE PLAYER MAY ROLL THE TWO DICE FROM 1 
TO N TIMES. IF T1 IS THE TOTAL OF DICE ON THE ITH 
ROLL, THEN THE PLAYERS SCORE FOR THE TURN IS T(1)+
T(2)+T(3)+.........+T(N). HOWEVER, AND HERE'S THE 
CATCH. IF ANY T(I)IS EQUAL TO T(1) THEN THE TURN IS 
OVER AND HIS SCORE FOR THAT ROUND IS ZERO AFTER 
EACH ROLL THAT DOESN'T EQUAL T(1), THE PLAYER CAN 
DECIDE WHETHER TO ROLL AGAIN OR STOP AND SCORE THE 
NUMBER OF POINTS ALREADY OBTAINED.
